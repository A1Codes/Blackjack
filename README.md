Blackjack Game
This program is a simple implementation of the classic game of Blackjack, also known as 21. It includes classes for Card, Deck, Hand, and Chips, as well as functions for taking bets, hitting, standing, and determining the winner.

To start the game, run the program and follow the instructions on the screen. The game will begin by shuffling the deck and dealing two cards to the player and dealer. The player will then be asked to make a bet and decide whether to hit or stand. If the player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose their bet. If the player stands, the dealer will then play their hand, hitting until their hand has a value of 17 or greater. The winner is determined based on the value of their hand, with aces counting as 1 or 11.

The program uses the random module to shuffle the deck and the os module to clear the console between each round.

This implementation of the game is for educational purposes only and does not include all the rules and nuances of a real-life Blackjack game.
